# Hands-On Project Report

## Hosting a Static Website on Amazon S3 with Versioning and Access Logs

---

## Objective

The objective of this exercise was to host a **static website** using **Amazon S3**, without using EC2, Apache, or any web server.
I also aimed to understand how **versioning**, **public access**, and **server access logging** work in S3, which are important DevOps concepts for storage management, rollback, and auditing.

---

## Tools and Services i Used

* Amazon S3
* AWS Management Console
* Static website template (downloaded from tooplate.com)
* Web browser

---

## Step 1: Preparing the Website Files

1. I downloaded a free static website template from **tooplate.com**.
2. The template was downloaded as a ZIP file.
3. I extracted the ZIP file, which produced a folder containing:

   * HTML files
   * CSS files
   * JavaScript files
   * Images and assets
   * Readme
4. These files were the contents I planned to upload to Amazon S3.

## Step 2: Creating the Main S3 Bucket for Website Hosting

1. I navigated to the **Amazon S3 service** in the AWS Console.
2. I created a new bucket to host the website.
3. I gave the bucket a **unique, lowercase name** which is **winter-gallery-s3**.
4. During bucket creation, I **enabled versioning**.
5. I completed the setup by creating the bucket.

This bucket was used to store and serve the website files.

## Step 3: Uploading Website Files to S3

1. I opened the newly created bucket.
2. I selected **Upload**.
3. I dragged and dropped **all extracted website files** of 2151_winter_gallery into the bucket.
4. I completed the upload using the AWS console UI.

At this point, all files were stored in S3, but the website was not yet accessible.

## Step 4: Creating a Separate Bucket for Access Logs

1. I created a **second S3 bucket**.
2. This bucket was used **only for storing access logs**.
3. I ensured the bucket name was lowercase and unique which is **winter-gallery-s3-accesslogs**.
4. I created the bucket without additional configuration.

This separation follows best practices for monitoring and auditing access.

## Step 5: Configuring Public Access for Website Files

1. I opened the main website bucket.
2. Under **Permissions**, I edited **Block Public Access**.
3. I unchecked the block public access option and saved the changes.
4. Under **Object Ownership**, I enabled **ACLs**.
5. I selected **all website objects**.
6. I used **Actions → Make public using ACL**.
7. I confirmed the warning since the website must be publicly accessible.

Now, the website files were publicly readable.

## Step 6: Enabling Static Website Hosting

1. I opened the **Properties** tab of the bucket.
2. I scrolled to **Static Website Hosting**.
3. I enabled static website hosting.
4. I set:

   * **Index document**: `index.html`
   * **Error document**: `error.html`
5. I saved the changes.
6. AWS provided a **static website URL** for the bucket.

## Step 7: Enabling Server Access Logging

1. In the **Properties** section of the website bucket, I enabled **Server Access Logging**.
2. I selected the previously created **log bucket** named **winter-gallery-s3-accesslogs** as the destination.
3. I kept the default log format.
4. I saved the configuration.

AWS automatically created the required bucket policy to allow log delivery.

---

## Step 8: Accessing the Website

1. I copied the **S3 static website URL**.
2. I pasted the URL into a web browser.
3. The website loaded successfully, confirming the hosting setup worked.

This confirmed that S3 can host static websites without servers or load balancers.

## Step 9: Understanding and Testing S3 Versioning

### Deleting a File

1. I selected a file and deleted it.
2. The file disappeared from the normal view.
3. When I enabled **Show Versions**, I saw a **delete marker**.
4. The original file still existed underneath.

![alt text](<Images/S3 show version after delete-1.png>)

### Restoring a Deleted File

1. I deleted the delete marker.
2. The file immediately became visible again.

### Overwriting a File

1. I modified `index.html` locally.
2. I uploaded the new `index.html` to the bucket.

3. A new version was created automatically.
4. The website initially returned **403 Forbidden** because the new file was private.

5. I made the new file public using ACLs.
6. The website reflected the new content.

![alt text](<Images/S3 make public using ACL for new index.html file-1.png>)

![alt text](<Images/s3 index.html work-1.png>)

### Rolling Back a Change

1. I deleted the latest version of `index.html`.
2. I permanently removed only that version.
3. The previous version became active again.
4. The website was restored successfully.

## Key Observations

* Every uploaded object is **private by default**.
* Making objects public is required for static hosting.
* Versioning does **not overwrite files** — it creates new versions.
* Deleting an object does not remove data unless all versions are deleted.
* Versioning increases storage usage and cost.
* Access logs are not immediate and appear after some time.

---

## This exercise demonstrates core DevOps principles

* **Infrastructure without servers** (serverless static hosting)
* **Version control for storage**
* **Rollback and recovery**
* **Audit and access logging**
* **Cost and risk awareness**

---

## I successfully

* Hosted a static website on Amazon S3
* Enabled public access safely
* Configured static website hosting
* Implemented access logging
* Tested versioning, deletion, and recovery
* Understood the operational and cost implications

This setup provides a simple, scalable, and cost-effective solution for hosting static web applications using AWS.
